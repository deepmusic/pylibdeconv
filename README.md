The PyLibDeconv project provides a [Python](http://www.python.org) wrapper to the C++ Deconv library by Y. Sun et al (see details in [J. Microscopy 236, 3:180-193, 2009](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2818.2009.03205.x/abstract)) using [SWIG](http://www.swig.org/) with [NumPy](http://numpy.scipy.org/) support. The wrapper is provided as Python libdeconv package.

Although the C++ Deconv library is available via its [SVN repository](http://svn.lsdcas.engineering.uiowa.edu/repos/lsdcas/trunk/deconv/) the Python libdeconv package ships Deconv sources (with bug fixes and few modifications) to ease the installation process.

A graphical user interface will be provided via [IOCBio project](http://code.google.com/p/iocbio/).
